# aws-ansible-playbooks
collection of ansible playbooks for user in a manual-run state with SSM or via AWX


**AWX PLAYBOOKS**
- Designed to be run with Ansible AWX In Mind, therefore fully-features

**SSM PLAYBOOKS**
- Designed to be run via Amazon SSM. Therefore these playbooks are a little more standalone and basic in their approach due to the singular 'chef-solo' runstyle of these playbooks.
